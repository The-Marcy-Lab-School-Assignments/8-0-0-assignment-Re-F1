# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in an `endpoint` as the first argument.

What is an endpoint in Express?

# Answer
An endpoint is a `unique URL path` that a server makes available for clients to send requests to using different methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc... Examples include /api/data or /api/users/:id, where :id represents a dynamic path parameter.

Example :

```js
app.get('/', serveIndex);
app.get('/about', serveAbout);
app.get('/api/hello', serveHello);
app.get('/api/data', serveData);
```
